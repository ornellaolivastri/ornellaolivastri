<!--
**ornellaolivastri/ornellaolivastri** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

 ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two projects: one based on java and the other in python
 ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of things shown in my repositories
 ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to learning, time management and efficient-organization
